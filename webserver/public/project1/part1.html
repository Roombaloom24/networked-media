  <!-- I think that I should make this about the empty mind, about it being completely empty, somewhat clear, then all of a sudden this machine apepars, or maybe a more abstract version of this
   growing form that continues, with every click to grow and you cant escape it until finanly it becomes clear again. I think maybe addind fake interaction like a back button? and then it continues to grow even when you click back. But
   towards the end it goes clear, and everything is ok again
